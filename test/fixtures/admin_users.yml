# Read about fixtures at https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/FixtureSet.html

# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the "{}" from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
one:
  email: admin1@example.com
  # encrypted_password can stay "", since tests likely don't log in via AdminUser
  encrypted_password: ""

two:
  email: admin2@example.com
  encrypted_password: ""
